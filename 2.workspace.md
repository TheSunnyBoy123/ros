# Setup
## Creating a Workspace

Create the directory and navigate to it (the src sub directory is a mandatory directory to have so we make that too)
~~~
root@docker-desktop:/# mkdir -p ~/tutorial_workspace/src && cd ~/tutorial_workspace/
root@docker-desktop:~/tutorial_workspace# 
~~~

Execute `catkin_make` to setup directories and files necessary for the [catkin workspace](https://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces) and build any packages in `/target_dir/src`.
~~~
root@docker-desktop:~/tutorial_workspace# catkin_make
~~~

Now we can look at the sub directories in this directory. 
~~~
root@docker-desktop:~/tutorial_workspace# ls
build  devel  src
~~~
1. `build`:  contains the files which are required to build (similar to compiling files) our packages
2. `devel`: All the binary files and objects which are built from the `src` directory
3. `src`: all our source code, every time we make a ROS package, we need to place it in this directory  

Source a setup file to allow our functions, files and variables in this workspace be accessed through the ROS environment we have
~~~
root@docker-desktop:~/tutorial_workspace# source devel/setup.bash
~~~

To make sure your workspace is properly overlayed by the setup script, make sure ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable includes the directory you're in.
